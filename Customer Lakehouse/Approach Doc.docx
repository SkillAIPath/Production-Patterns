Customer Lifecycle Lakehouse ‚Äì Enterprise Approach Document
1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Overview
This project establishes a Lakehouse architecture to track and optimize the Customer Lifecycle for a digital product business across Asia-Pacific markets.
The solution is designed to:

Ingest, process, and analyze data from transactional systems, engagement platforms, and CRM tools.

Monitor customer journey stages, agent performance, revenue metrics, and cohort retention.

Enable business users through Power BI dashboards integrated with CI/CD pipelines for automated data refreshes.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Modeling (Gold Layer Objects)

Table Name	Type	Notes
DimCustomer	Dimension	SCD-2, tracks region and plan changes
DimSubscriptionPlan	Dimension	SCD-3, tracks plan features
DimProduct	Dimension	Product catalog, categories, pricing
DimAgent	Dimension	Sales/support agents, SLA metrics
DimTime	Dimension	Full calendar attributes
FactTransactions	Fact	Transactions (customer, product, agent)
FactEngagement	Fact	Engagement scores (customer, date)
FactGoalTracking	Fact	Targets vs. actuals (MRR, Retention)
5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Flow (Medallion Architecture)
üîπ Bronze Layer:
Ingested Data:

customers_raw, transactions_raw, engagement_raw

Partitioned by date for scalability.

Stored in Delta format.

üîπ Silver Layer:
Transformations:

Derive Lifecycle Stages (Active, At Risk, Churned).

Calculate Engagement Scores.

Merge into Customer Profile table.

üîπ Gold Layer:
Star Schema:

Fact tables linked to dimensions (customer, product, agent, time).

Versioned Dimensions (SCD-2 & SCD-3).

Supports Power BI reporting layer.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Power BI Reporting Design

Tab Name	Focus
Customer Lifecycle	Executive KPIs, overall lifecycle distribution
Acquisition	New customer trends, acquisition funnels
Activation	Activation rates, feature adoption, cohort analysis
Engagement	Engagement score trends, feature usage, session data
Monetization	Revenue breakdown, MRR trends, product performance
Retention	Retention cohorts, churn rates, predictive analysis
üß© Visual Standards:
1920√ó1080 canvas, blue-teal theme.

Filters on left: Date, Region, Subscription Plan.

6 KPI cards, 6 charts, 1 table per tab.

Tooltips for added realism.

Tab consistency: Same layout, spacing, and visible tab bar across all images.

7Ô∏è‚É£ DevOps & Deployment

Area	Toolset
CI/CD for Data Pipelines	Azure DevOps, Databricks CLI, DLT JSON config
Power BI Refresh Automation	Azure DevOps YAML, Power BI REST API
8Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring & Governance
DLT lineage views for data flow tracing.

Audit logs on ingestion and transformation steps.

Optional alerting mechanisms on data freshness and anomalies.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Data Versioning
Delta Lake time travel enabled.

SCD-2/3 applied to dimensions:

DimCustomer tracks region/plan changes.

DimSubscriptionPlan tracks plan cost/feature changes.
